# Initiative: Implementing a DevOps Process for Continuous Integration and Deployment

## Introduction

The goal of this initiative is to implement a DevOps process for continuous integration and deployment to improve software development efficiency, speed up the release process, and reduce errors in production. By implementing a DevOps process, teams can more quickly and efficiently deliver high-quality software to customers.

## Epics

1.  [Implement Version Control](/documentation/templates/theme/initiatives/epics/ImplementVersionControl.md)
2.  [Configure Continuous Integration](/documentation/templates/theme/initiatives/epics/ContinuousIntegration.md)
3.  [Automated Testing and Deployment](/documentation/templates/theme/initiatives/epics/AutomatedTestingandDeployment.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Implement Version Control
- Configure Continuous Integration
- Automate Testing
- Automate Deployment

## Test Requirements
- Automated testing will be done using Playwright, an end-to-end testing tool that can simulate user interactions with web applications. 
- In addition to automated testing, manual testing will also be performed to ensure that the application functions as intended in a real-world environment.
