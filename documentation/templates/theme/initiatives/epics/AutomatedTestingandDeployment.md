# Epic: Automated Testing and Deployment

## Introduction

Automated testing and deployment are critical components of modern software development, allowing teams to quickly and reliably build, test, and deploy new features and bug fixes. The purpose of this epic is to implement a comprehensive automated testing and deployment process for our application, improving the quality and reliability of our code and reducing the time and effort required for manual testing and deployment.
### Acceptance Criteria:
- Define the scope of the automated testing and deployment process, including which parts of the application will be tested and deployed automatically.
- Select appropriate testing and deployment tools and technologies, such as Playwright, Selenium, Jenkins, or CircleCI.
- Automate the deployment process to staging and production environments to ensure that the application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.
- Create a rollback plan in case of deployment failures or issues.
