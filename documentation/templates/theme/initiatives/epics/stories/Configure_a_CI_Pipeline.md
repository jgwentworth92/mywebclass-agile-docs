#  Configure a CI Pipeline
## Story

"As a member of the development team, I want to configure a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for our application, so that we can automatically build, test, and deploy code changes as they are made, and ensure that our code meets our quality standards before deploying to production.."

Acceptance Criteria:

- Connect the CI tool to our version control system and configure the pipeline to trigger a build and test with each new commit.
- Set up a build environment that can build and test the application code, including any necessary dependencies and configuration files.
- Configure the pipeline to notify the team of any failed builds or tests, so that we can quickly identify and fix issues.

## Test Requirements
-Manually verify CI Pipline works.
-use automatied tests via playwright to verify its functionality.
